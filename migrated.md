# This is being worked on and is not the official difficulty list!

Welcome to the new and experimental version of the difficulty list, reformatted for easier data reading in an unofficial visualizer webpage.

Any information, ranking, or rating in this file is not representative of the actual difficulty list. Until everything is finished and ready to go, this list will not be used in the meantime. DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!
