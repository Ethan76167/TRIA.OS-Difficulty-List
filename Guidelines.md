**GUIDELINES IN ADDING TRIA MAPS**

Welcome to the official TRIA.os Difficulty List, a map list dedicated 
to listing the hardest recognized maps of TRIA.os. If you are in need
of extra help, you can reach out in our server here:

Instructions on contributing are also available in the server, at `#how-to-contribute`.

FORMAT FOR ADDING AN ENTRY:
(LIST NO.) **Map Name** by Creators [ID] [YouTube Video Link]

EXAMPLE:
2. **Kneeling Shore** by Tac_taillike [10148804609/kneeling] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEGJxiDmx6Y]

-- GENERAL GUIDELINES
1. The entry for new submissions must be a recognized map of TRIA.
2. Maps must not be a challenge or buff to an already existing map.
3. No joke maps.
4. The admins have the right to reject your submissions based on varying factors.
5. If a map is currently broken and is seeking fixes, please label the map as (BROKEN) before the Map Name, also **bold** formatted.
5. Should you be unsure of a map's worthiness to be added, reach out to us in the official Discord.

-- FORMAT GUIDELINES
1. If there are multiple creators, please list your team name instead.
2. If your map does not have a team name, list the main creator/host instead.
3. If the map has a custom ID (Generally found in featured maps), please list in the ID as `numerical ID/custom ID`. Example: `10148804609/kneeling`
4. The YouTube video has to be a map completion video. Nothing else.

Again if you have any questions, feel free to contact us on Discord!
