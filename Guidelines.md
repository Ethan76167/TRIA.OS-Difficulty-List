> **GENERAL GUIDELINES**
1. The entry for new submissions must be a recognized map made **for** TRIA.os.
2. Maps must not be a buff to an already existing map.
3. No joke maps.
4. The admins have the right to reject your submissions based on varying factors.
5. If a map is currently broken and is seeking fixes, please label the map as (BROKEN) before the Map Name, also **bold** formatted.
6. Reach out to us in the official Discord should you be unsure of a map's worthiness, or if you would like to switch the placement of a map.
7. The ID should be the official ID uploaded by one of the map's creators.

> **FORMAT GUIDELINES**
1. If there are multiple creators, please list your team name instead.
2. If your map does not have a team name, list the main creator/host instead.
3. If the map has a custom ID (Generally found in featured maps), please list in the ID as `numerical ID/custom ID`. Example: `10148804609/kneeling`
4. A YouTube video with the map completion (Preferably the official verification video) has to be added.
