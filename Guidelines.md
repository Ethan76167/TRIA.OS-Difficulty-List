EXAMPLE:

> **ALL LIST GUIDELINES**
1. The entry for new submissions must be a recognized map made **for** TRIA.os.
2. Maps must not be a buff to an already existing map.
3. No joke maps.
4. The admins have the right to reject your submissions based on varying factors.
5. If a map is currently broken and is seeking fixes, please label the map as [!] infront of the map name, also **bold** formatted. Do not list a map that is not planning to be fixed.

Example: **[!] Kneeling Shore**

6. If the bug is map breaking (Its impossible to beat the map because of it) label the map as [!!!] infront of the map name, also **bold** formatted.

Example: **[!!!] Kneeling Shore**

7. Reach out to us in the official Discord should you be unsure of a map's worthiness, or if you would like to switch the placement of a map.
8. The ID should be the official ID uploaded by one of the map's creators.
9. All maps listed (at the moment) should be Divine or harder.
10. All Lists have a sub-guideline accoridng to its respective list, look at the bottom of this file to see them.

> **FORMAT GUIDELINES**
1. If there are multiple creators, please list your team name instead.
2. If your map does not have a team name, list the main creator/host instead.
3. If the map has a custom ID (Generally found in featured maps), please list in the ID as `numerical ID/custom ID`. 

Example: `10148804609/kneeling`

4. A YouTube video with the map completion (Preferably the official verification video) has to be added.


> **List.md GUIDELINES**

The point of this list is to give players a fun enjoyable list of hard maps to play to improve their skill in a orderly fashion.

1. All maps here must be agreed upon quality enjoyable maps.
2. All maps here must also not be made for the intention of becoming the hardest map in TRIA.OS, this leads to unfun and sometimes cancer GP, aswell as clout chasing.
3. All maps here must have at least 1 victor not including the creator/verifier.

> **Extras.md GUIDELINES**

This list is meant for lesser known maps that arent up to the standards of quality of the List.md. Maps here are much more leniant however they still fall under the "ALL LIST GUIDELINES" rules.

1. Maps here are listed in a numerical fashion however in no particular order instead they are listed as either Harder or Less Hard than **Dsytopia V4**, this is to keep the list easy to manage when new maps are added.
2. Do not include any maps already listed on the List.md.
3. Maps here can be posted without a non creator/verfier as long as it has a creator/verifier video. If this applies label the map as (No Victors) infront of the map name, not bold formatted.

> **Public List.md GUIDELINES**

This list is specifically only for maps inside the public TRIA.OS Map list used inside of Public servers. So do not add or remove any maps unless the public map list changes in game.

2. If you wish to change one of the listing's placement check with the community inside https://discord.gg/gzY665w2K2 first before creating your pull request.
