## Information
The TRIA.OS Difficulty List is an official outlet for recognizing the hardest maps in TRIA, with a team working to update, review and give an accurate view of the difficulty of certain maps within the higher difficulties.

Maps that are submitted must use a format such as:
> Eternal
  1. ``7.XX`` **The Sin** by S_D1am0nd, alex28901, fxrezful, vX_Soraa, & Vlayrs [fayvr] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYPNKpdwha4]
> Divine
  1. ``6.XX`` **Kneeling Shore** by tac_taillike [kneeling] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEGJxiDmx6Y]

## Map Guidelines
This is something that should be looked at and taken into account for everyone, because ***no matter how many complaints the team gets these specific rules will always apply no matter the case***. These rules also apply if you would like to contribute to the list. Pull requests for difficulty will be taken into account by the team and will be approved if the team agrees.

<hr>

1. Despite how unserious some maps may seem, if they fit the criteria of an already Verified map (aka. map is already verified into the game) they will still be allowed on the list.
2. If you think a maps rating is unclear, or a map is missing, wrong or there's an issue with the list, please report it in [#general](https://discord.com/channels/1045548615709491261/1045548615709491264) of the Discord and we'll get to it ASAP.
3. Your map can be a buffed version as long as it is in a seperate verified map, if the map gets buffed after there are victors it will be blacklisted from the list and will only be able to come back if changes are reverted, same goes for publishing the map on a different ID after there are victors. (this is also grounds for map unverification) Slight changes like qol updates are allowed which you can change the gameplay as long as it doesn't drastically affect the map's difficulty.
4. If a map is currently broken/bugged but still beatable, it will have a [!] infront of the map name with bold formatting.

Example: **[!] Kneeling Shore**

5. If the bug is map breaking (Its impossible to beat the map because of it) the map will have a [!!!] infront of the map name with bold formatting. Make sure you report these maps to the creator(s) to get it fixed, if you cannot do this, report it to TRIA developers that way the map can be unverified. 

Example: **[!!!] Kneeling Shore**

6. All maps listed be Divine or harder (aside from Public map list).
